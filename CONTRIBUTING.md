## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.4 or later
- Git
- Make (for running build tasks)

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/publer.go.git
   cd publer.go
   ```

3. Add the upstream repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/thrawn/publer.go.git
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

5. Run the test suite to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## Making Changes

### Branch Strategy

- Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-media-upload`, `fix/rate-limit-handling`)
- Keep branches focused on a single change

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Development Process

1. **Understand the codebase**: Review the implementation plans in the [`plans/`](./plans/) directory
2. **Write tests first**: Follow TDD principles when possible
3. **Implement your changes**: Keep changes focused and well-documented
4. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure all tests pass and add new tests for your changes
5. **Update documentation**: Update README or code comments if needed

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make cover

# Run linting
make lint

# Run all CI checks
make ci
```

### Test Guidelines

Follow the project's testing patterns as defined in the codebase:

- Tests MUST be in the `package XXX_test` format (not `package XXX`)
- Test names should be camelCase starting with a capital letter
- Use table-driven tests for parameter validation
- Use `github.com/stretchr/testify/require` and `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert`
- Use `require` for critical assertions, `assert` for non-critical ones
- Avoid explanatory messages in assertions
- Be explicit rather than DRY in tests


### Mock Server

The project includes a mock server for testing. When adding new API endpoints:

1. Add mock responses to `v1/mock_server.go`
2. Ensure realistic response structures
3. Include error scenarios (rate limits, validation errors, etc.)
4. Test both success and failure cases

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Sync with upstream**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Rebase your branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

3. **Run tests**: Ensure all tests pass
   ```bash
   make ci
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add support for media uploads in posts"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Clear and descriptive summary of changes
- **Description**: Follow this format:
  ```markdown
  ### Purpose
  A paragraph describing what this change intends to achieve

  ### Implementation
  - An explanation of each major code change made
  ```
- **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes
- **Breaking Changes**: Clearly document any breaking changes
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

## Code Style

### Go Code Guidelines

Follow the project's established patterns:

- Use `const` for variables that don't change and are used more than once
- Prefer short, clear variable names (1-2 words)
- Avoid local variables used only once - inline values directly
- Use full words instead of abbreviations
- Use `const` for constants: `const numRetries = 3`
- Use `lo.ToPtr()` for creating pointers to local variables

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing:

1. Check the [implementation plans](./plans/) for context
2. Look at existing code for patterns
3. Open an issue for discussion before making large changes
4. Ask questions in pull request comments
